# Markdown Style Guide

This document contains formatting standards for creating readable, consistent files using Markdown - without wasting time changing formatting.

## Basic conventions for Markdown files

- Denote **bold** text using the asterisk format: `**bold text**`.
- Denote _italic_ text using the underscore format: `_emphasized text_`.
- Never leave trailing whitespace. Force linebreaks by using a blank line between paragraphs, not trailing spaces (it's much easier to read in an editor anyway).
- End files with a newline (see [this explanation](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/no-newline-at-end-of-file)).
- Never use consecutive blank lines outside of code samples. A single blank line is always enough in Markdown.

## Headings

- Header text must use the `atx-style` with no closing `#` character.
- Include a single space between the `#` and the text of the Header^[1](#1).

    ```markdown
    # Header 1

    ## Header 2

    ### Header 3
    ```

- Headers spanning more than 80 characters should be re-evaluated.
- Headers must be preceded by a newline (except at the beginning of a document) and followed by a newline always.
- The first header in a file should be an `h1`.
- Headers should never increase by more than one "level" from one header to the next. Think of higher-level headers as though they are nested within their parent, forming a hierarchy like the Table of Contents.

    ```markdown
    This is wrong.

    # Header 1

    ### Header 3
    ```

    ```markdown
    This is correct.

    # Header 1

    ## Header 2
    ```

## Horizontal Rules

The convention for horizontal rules in this style guide is to use hyphens (instead of asterisks or underscores). Horizontal rules should span 80 characters for readability.

```markdown
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Lists

- Unordered lists are denoted with a `-` (a hyphen and a space). Hyphens tend to be consistent across monospace fonts (being displayed at half of the line height) and seem to be the most common "list character" anyway.
- Nested list items must be indented 4 spaces further than their parent.

    ```markdown
    This is arbitrary text, an unordered list begins on the next line.

    - list item 1
    - list item 2

        - sub-list item
    ```

- Lists must be preceded by a newline (except at the beginning of a document) and followed by a newline always.

    ```markdown
    This text precedes a list of things.

    - list item 1
    - list item 2

        1. sub-list item 1
        2. sub-list item 2

    - list item 3
    - list item 4

    This is text of any kind that follows a list.
    ```

## Code

- **Inline code** must use single backticks and must not have spaces between the backtick characters and the code.

    ```markdown
    # Bad
    ` .this-is-wrong `

    # Good
    `.this-is-good`
    ```

- **Fenced code blocks** must be preceded and followed by a newline.
- When used inside _list items_, **fenced code blocks** must be indented as if they were one level deeper that the list item that contains them.

    ````markdown
    - This list item contains a fenced code block.
    - Let's show how it might interact with a list.

        ```
        .code-example {
          property: value;
        }
        ```

    There is a newline above this paragraph because it is both the end of a list and because it follows a fenced code block.
    ````

- As long as the parser supports it; code blocks should not be denoted with indentation. Using back-ticks is much more explicit than 4 spaces or 1 tab.

## Tables

Like fenced code blocks, tables in Markdown are provided by [Markdown Extra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown_Extra) which seems to be pretty widely implemented.

- Pipe characters must be preceded and followed by spaces for readability.
- Table column width should be determined by the longest cell in the column.
- Always format tables so they are readable in pre-processing.

    ```markdown
    # This is completely unreadable, although it is technically valid.

    table header | other table header
    --- | ---
    table data | other table data
    ```

- Never use preceding or trailing pipes when writing tables.

    ```markdown
    | table header | other table header |
    | ------------ | ------------------ |
    | table data   | table data         |
    ```

- Tables must always be preceded and followed by newlines.

### Table example

_This table meets all the criteria:_

```markdown
Group                     | Domain          | First Appearance
------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------
ShinRa                    | Mako Reactors   | FFVII
Moogles                   | MogNet          | FFIII
Vana'diel Chocobo Society | Chocobo Raising | FFXI:TOAU
```

_A handsome table in pre-processed Markdown is also handsome when rendered:_

Group                     | Domain          | First Appearance
------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------
ShinRa                    | Mako Reactors   | FFVII
Moogles                   | MogNet          | FFIII
Vana'diel Chocobo Society | Chocobo Raising | FFXI:TOAU
